# 1 Billion rows challenge

## Restrictions
I cannot use any library except the python standard library just to make this fun , i will do this challenge again in go lang too just to extend my knowledege in go lang as i am very weak but here we are 

### Approach 1  
Day 1 :This was the most naive approach with async sadly enough the code does not run with a billion rows altogether I get no output need to figure this out

Day 2 :Well the initial enthusiams has worn off and i have no clue how this all works turns out python does not support multithreading idek know what that means in depth but sure from what i know i need to use multiprocessing rather than asycnio , went ahead going to read code of people smarter than me to understand how this works as in my 1 month of experience reading code makes you better dev rather than writing code
